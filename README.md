# Overview

Edu is derived from the [Edu-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Edu-DiscordBot) by @Cog-Creators.

[Installation](#installation) is easy, and you do **NOT** need to know anything about coding! Aside
from installing and updating, every part of the bot can be controlled from within Discord.

**The default set of modules includes and is not limited to:**

- Moderation features (kick/ban/softban/hackban, mod-log, filter, chat cleanup)
- Trivia (lists are included and can be easily added)
- Music features (YouTube, SoundCloud, local files, playlists, queues)
- Stream alerts (Twitch, Youtube, Picarto)
- Bank (slot machine, user credits)
- Custom commands
- Imgur/gif search
- Admin automation (self-role assignment, cross-server announcements, mod-mail reports)
- Customizable command permissions

**Additionally, other [plugins](#plugins) (cogs) can be easily found and added from our growing
community of cog repositories.**

# Installation

**The following platforms are officially supported:**

- [Windows](https://edu-discordbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install_windows.html)
- [MacOS](https://edu-discordbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install_linux_mac.html)
- [Most major linux distributions](https://edu-discordbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install_linux_mac.html)

# Plugins

Edu is fully modular, allowing you to load and unload plugins of your choice, and install 3rd party
plugins directly from Discord! A few examples are:

- Cleverbot integration (talk to Edu and she talks back)
- Ban sync
- Welcome messages
- Casino
- Reaction roles
- Slow Mode
- AniList
- And much, much more!

Feel free to take a [peek](https://index.discord.red) at a list of
available 3rd party cogs!

# Overview

Edu is derived from the [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/mavaddat-javid-education/Edu-DiscordBot) by @mavaddat-javid-education.

[Installation](#installation) is easy, and you do **NOT** need to know anything about coding! Aside
from installing and updating, every part of the bot can be controlled from within Discord.

**The default set of modules includes and is not limited to:**

- Moderation features (kick/ban/softban/hackban, mod-log, filter, chat cleanup)
- Trivia (lists are included and can be easily added)
- Music features (YouTube, SoundCloud, local files, playlists, queues)
- Stream alerts (Twitch, Youtube, Hitbox, Picarto)
- Bank (slot machine, user credits)
- Custom commands
- Imgur/gif search
- Admin automation (self-role assignment, cross-server announcements, mod-mail reports)
- Customisable command permissions

**Additionally, other [plugins](#plugins) (cogs) can be easily found and added from our growing
community of cog repositories.**

# Installation

**The following platforms are officially supported:**

- [Windows](https://Edu-DiscordBot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install_windows.html)
- [MacOS](https://Edu-DiscordBot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install_linux_mac.html)

plugins directly from Discord! A few examples are:

- Ban sync
- Welcome messages
- Casino
- Reaction roles
- Slow Mode
- AniList
- And much, much more!

available 3rd party cogs!
